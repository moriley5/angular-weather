# AngularJS - Travel Destinations 2017

## Project Objectives

* Learn and utilize AngularJS
* Consume a third party API (Dark Sky)
* Deploy the app to Heroku

## Summary

I created a simple app to store my potential travel destinations for this year and display the current weather in each of those locations. The main goal of this project was to learn how to write AngularJS, and I used version 1.5.11 to accomplish this.

The Dark Sky API allows users to look up the weather anywhere on the globe, with the following features:

* Current weather conditions
* Minute-by-minute forecasts out to one hour
* Hour-by-hour and day-by-day forecasts out to seven days
* Hour-by-hour and day-by-day observations going back decades

## Features In Progress

* Implement animated weather icons
* Transfer code to an AngularJS application skeleton
* Deploy the app to Heroku
